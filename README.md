# WPF C# Tutorial â€“ Making a Calculator App in Visual Studio
In this tutorial I am very happy to start on the long awaited WPF C# video tutorial series. This is the first attempt on making a simple calculator in visual studio using the WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) format with C# programming. 

In this tutorial we will briefly go over how to make simple grids using rows and columns to place text boxes, labels and buttons to display the UI for a calculator. 

We will add different events to the buttons so we can start the calculations and display the results on the screen. I hope you enjoy this tutorial and I will be uploading more WPF C# tutorials soon. 

Happy Programming moo out.
